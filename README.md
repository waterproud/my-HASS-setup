# my-HASS-setup
This is my personal HASS setup, built with the awesome üçÑ mushroom custom cards and browser-mod. 

In particular, browser-mod allows me to keep the whole connected home's main controls and entities on a single lovelace tab (home tab). But, tapping on any of the cards, a dedicated pop-up view can be opened, which provides either more details or more controls over the desired entity.

The mushroom custom cards (mainly the template ones) are then used to display the entities information, with different icons and color-coding depending on status, reporting, alerts, etc.
